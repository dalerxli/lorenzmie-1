# NAME:
#       sphericalfield
#
# PURPOSE:
#       Calculates the complex electric field defined by an array of scattering
#       coefficients.
#
# CATEGORY:
#       Holography, light scattering, microscopy
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE:
#       field = sphericalfield(x, y, z, a, lambda, $
#                           mpp = mpp)
#
# INPUTS:
#       x: [npts] array of pixel coordinates [pixels]
#       y: [npts] array of pixel coordinates [pixels]
#       z: If field is required in a single plane, then
#          z is the plane's distance from the sphere's center
#          [pixels].
#          Otherwise, z is an [npts] array of coordinates.
#
#       NOTE: Ideally, x, y and z should be double precision.
#             This is left to the calling program for efficiency.
#
#       a: [2,nc] array of a and b scattering coefficients, where
#          nc is the number of terms required for convergence.
#
#       lambda: wavelength of light in medium [pixels]
#
# KEYWORD FLAGS:
#       cartesian: If set, return field components in Cartesian
#           coordinates.  Default: Spherical polar coordinates
#
# OUTPUTS:
#       field: [npts,3] complex values of field at the positions r.
#              [:,0]: r component
#              [:,1]: theta component
#              [:,2]: phi component
#
#              If CARTESIAN is set:
#              [:,0]: x component (incident polarization)
#              [:,1]: y component (transverse component)
#              [:,2]: z component (axial component, relative to
#              incident beam).

#
# MODIFICATION HISTORY:
# Written by David G. Grier, New York University, 5/2007
# 6/9/2007: DGG finally read Section 4.8 in Bohren and Huffman about
#    numerical stability of the recursions used to compute the scattering
#    coefficients.  Feh.  Result is a total rewrite.
# 6/20/2007: DGG Calculate \tau_n(\cos\theta) and \pi_n(\cos\theta)
#    according to recurrence relations in 
#    W. J. Wiscombe, Appl. Opt. 19, 1505-1509 (1980).
#    This is supposed to improve numerical accuracy.
# 2/8/2008: DGG. Replaced single [3,npts] array of input coordinates
#    with two [npts] arrays for x and y, and a separate input for z.
#    Eliminated double() call for coordinates.  Z may have 1 element or
#    npts elements. Small documentation fixes.
# 4/3/2008: Bo Sun (Sephiroth), NYU: Calculate Lorenz-Mie a and b
#    coefficients using continued fractions rather than recursion.
#    Osman Akcakir from Arryx pointed out that the results are
#    more accurate in extreme cases.  Method described in
#    William J. Lentz, "Generating Bessel functions in Mie scattering
#    calculations using continued fractions," Appl. Opt. 15, 668-671
#    (1976).
# 4/4/2008: DGG small code clean-ups and documentation.  Added
#    RECURSIVE keyword for backward compatibility in computing a and b
#    coefficients.
# 4/11/2008: Sephiroth: Corrected small error in jump code for
#    repeated fractions in Mie coefficients.
# 6/25/2008: DGG Don't clobber x coordinate input values.
# 10/9/2008: DGG adapted from SPHEREFIELD by separating out
#    calculation of scattering coefficients, a_n and b_n.  This
#    is therefore more general, and can be replaced more
#    readily with a GPU-accelerated version.
# 10/13/2008: DGG eliminated RECURSIVE keyword.
# 06/18/2010: DGG Added COMPILE_OPT.
# 09/04/2011: DGG Compute -\tau_n rather than \tau_n
