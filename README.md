<b>Python routines for producing and analyzing in-line holographic video microscopy (HVM) images </b>

# lorenzmie.. what is it good for?
`lorenzmie` provides a set of routines for producing and analyzing holographic images of transparent dielectric spheres (pretty niche, huh?). The methods provided here have been adopted, utilized and incrementally improved by David Grier's physics lab in the Center for Soft Matter research at NYU.

Why should one care about holographic images of transparent spheres? As

# Coming Soon.
1.`svr` - Calculating holograms is computationally expensive. Instead, support vector machines can offer a less precise, yet computational cheap method for analyzing holographic images.

2.`debyewolf` - Current implementations of HVM assume the fields produced at the focal plane of an object are the same fields that arrive in the camera plane. `debyewolf` will utilize the Debye-Wolf integral (along with the abbe-sine condition and the conservation of energy) to account for the changes in amplitude, phase and direction imparted on the field present at the camera.
